Copy UML Node, wrong size
Change to DQMH raph, error

Bug:
-Interface Method under virtual folder
UML:
-Open New Project: APP_PROJECT_NEW Missing
-Get/Set<Property> needs fix
Struct/Enum Icon should be auto created.

Design Desc Scroll Bar
-Implement interface By Aggregation

Abstract Method Only Must Call

Support Interface creation and analyse from UML
Better Auto Layout

Create a new project automatically when creating class with no project active. (or ask to open one)
Singleton GOOP4, don’t become singleton?!?! 5x6x5
Fix Unbundle by name don’t work when creating classes from the UML modeller. (If no attribute exists remove, and remove dead wires.)
Get Property Method is putting the label on the wrong side.
Maybe make you own set default class and lvlib configs based on INI file settings.
After removing some class methods in the code, and when selecting Generate Classes no classes are visible but it still generates the methods, but it fails if VI name already exists and dies. (Destroy VI can’t re recreated.


In Create Class API, wire up ClassIcon 
API Add Design Pattern ==> Implement Interface Design Pattern

Atfer craeted alsses from UML, lots of VI's classes needs to be resaved, due to connector pane changes 

-Fixed PropertyNode Method Control/Indicator location

Sync classes:
Don't use Class.ctl
Support Actors (inside lvlibs)

From UML, when creating a sub class and you select diffrent connectorpane settings?!?!

Broadcast event don't set the EventName
We can't detect if teh Event Script VI is running or not, but we can just check when the Main window has become idle.
Then we know it'a done.
The Broadcast didn't deetct if the Event name has been created.
The "Creation Progress", dialog, should be hidden when we go to the Event GUI.
If all events have been created, close the Event GUI.
